üèó Automatically generating builders :construction_worker: for Kotlin `data classes`.

*(This annotation processor **IS INCREMENTAL**)* 
  
Usage  
=====  
  
*For a working usage of this library see the `sample/` module.*  
  
  
 1. (*optional - for **Android** projects*) add to your app's `build.gradle`:  
    ```groovy  
    android {  
        kotlinOptions.jvmTarget = '1.8'  
    }  
    ```  
  
 2. Add to `@DataClassBuilder` annotation your `data class` (without `companion object`)
    ```kotlin
    @DataClassBuilder  
    data class User(  
        val name: String = "Anonymous",  
        val age: Int,  
        val photoUrl: String? = null  
    ) {  
        companion object //<-- OPTIONAL companion object
    }  
    ```  
       
 3. Use the generated builder to create your `data class`:
    ```kotlin
    //1. Java-style builder
    val jane = dataClassBuilder(User::class)
        .name("Jane")
        .age(12)
        .build()
    ```
    or
    ```kotlin
    //2. Kotlin DSL builder
    val jane = buildDataClass(User::class) {
        name = "Jane"
        age = 12
    }
    ```
    or
    ```kotlin
    //3. companion Java-style builder (generated if companion is present)
    val jane = User.dataClassBuilder()
        .name("Jane")
        .age(12)
        .build()
    ```
    or
    ```kotlin
    //4. companion Kotlin DSL builder (generated if companion is present)
    val jane = User.buildDataClass {
        name = "Jane"
        age = 12
    }
    ```
  
Including In Your Project  
-------------------------  
Add in your `build.gradle`:  
```xml  
repositories {  
    maven { url 'https://dl.bintray.com/blipinsk/maven/' }  
}  
  
dependencies {  
    kapt "com.bartoszlipinski:data-class-builder-compiler:0.1.0"  
    implementation "com.bartoszlipinski:data-class-builder:0.1.0"  
}  
```
